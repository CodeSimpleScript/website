### Bugs fixed
* If you use a function like `s.string_replace()` with a space replace like in the example `v.name=s.string_replace("-"," ",v.newname)` it was removing the space, but now will keep it if the value is ONLY a space.

### New system functions
* `s.random_string_phrase(number)` - Will generate a random dash separated phrase like `crape-myrtle-pigeon`. The number supplied will be the number of words used. It will default to 50/50 chance of 2 or 3 words.
* `s.string_first_word_uppercase(string)` - Will only make the first word have a upper case starting character, making a string like `crape myrtle pigeon` become `Crape myrtle pigeon`.
* `s.system_maxtime(seconds)` - Sets the max amount of time the page/scripts will run before closing. Default is 20 seconds.
* `s.system_sleep_second(seconds)` - Pauses the script from running for so many seconds.
* `s.system_sleep_ms(millisecond)` - Pauses the script from running for so many milliseconds, so a value of `2000` would be 2 seconds.
* `s.sha1(string)` - returns a sha1 hash of the string given.
* `s.md5(string)` - returns a md5 hash of the string given.
* `s.get_useragent()` - Returns the users current useragent string.

### Other new features
* You can give seconds to advanced the timestamp when calling `s.timestamp()`. So running `s.timestamp(5)` will give you what the timestamp will be in 5 seconds.
